# mybb-approvefilter

Plugin for Mybb 1.8 Forums to filter new thread subjects and message.
Filters can be set as regex expressions for subject and message individually. 
The configuration contains one regex expression per line. 
Validation is happening only on new threads, it does not already existing threads.
